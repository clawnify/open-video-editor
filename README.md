# Open Video Editor

An open-source, **agent-friendly video editor**. Compose videos as plain **HTML on a timeline**, drop in your own media (logos, product demos), preview with a scrubbable playhead, and render to **MP4**.

Built on **[HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes)** (HTML → MP4, Apache-2.0) — so there's no proprietary timeline format and no per-seat license. A composition is just HTML: humans can tweak it, and AI agents can author it end to end.

## Why

Most programmatic video tools lock you into a component framework or a paid license. Here a video is **HTML you already know** — elements positioned on tracks with simple `data-*` timing attributes, animated with GSAP/CSS/Lottie/Three.js. That makes it trivial for an agent to generate, and trivial for a person to read and adjust.

## Features

- **Timeline editor** — tracks, clips, a time ruler, and a draggable playhead that scrubs the preview. Clips are parsed straight from your composition's timing attributes.
- **Live preview** — see the composition animate as you edit; one master clock keeps the preview and the timeline in sync.
- **Bring your own media** — upload logos and product-demo clips and reference them by path (`assets/your-logo.png`) right in the HTML.
- **One-click render** — produces a real MP4, stored and played back in the gallery.
- **Agent-ready** — a clean REST API (`/api/compositions`, `/api/assets`, `/api/renders`) and an `agent.md` so an AI agent can author and render videos without a human in the loop.

## How a composition works

A composition is one HTML fragment. The root carries the canvas size; timed elements get `class="clip"` plus `data-start` / `data-duration` (seconds) / `data-track-index`, and animations are registered on a paused GSAP timeline:

```html
<div id="root" data-composition-id="promo" data-width="1920" data-height="1080">
  <img src="assets/logo.png" class="clip" data-start="0" data-duration="6" data-track-index="0" />
  <h1 id="title" class="clip" data-start="0.5" data-duration="6" data-track-index="0"
      style="position:absolute;top:48%;left:50%;transform:translate(-50%,-50%);color:#fff;font-size:90px">

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
    tl.from("#title", { opacity: 0, y: 40, duration: 1 }, 0.5);
    window.__timelines = { promo: tl };
  </script>
</div>
```

The editor reads those clips into the timeline automatically.

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # editor UI + API, with a local database & storage
```

Open the editor, hit **New composition** for a starter, edit the HTML in the **Compose** tab, drop media in **Media**, scrub the timeline, and render from **Renders**.

## Deploy

This is a [Clawnify](https://clawnify.com) app — deploy it to your org with the CLI:

```bash
npx clawnify deploy
```

Rendering runs on Clawnify's managed render service, so deployed instances need no local video toolchain.

## Project layout

```

  client/app.tsx     # editor UI: compositions, timeline, media, renders
  server/            # REST API (compositions, assets, renders) + preview

```
